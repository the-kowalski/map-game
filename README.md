# Map Guessing Game

This is a small map guessing game developed with react, mapbox-gl and turf.

## Gameplay

You start with a score of 1500km and have to find the stated city in europe. In order to do that you place a marker on the spot, where you assume the city and then check if you guessed correctly. The difference between your marker and the correct marker gets deducted from you score. The game is over, when your score reaches 0.
